<H1><A NAME="section_1">2 TOP LEVEL</A></H1>

<P>This lesson defines what we want to create and the top level VHDL
file for it.

<H2><A NAME="section_1_1">2.1 Design Purpose</A></H2>

<P>We assume that the purpose of the design is to build an FPGA with
the following features:

<UL>
  <LI>a CPU similar to the Atmel ATmega8,
  <LI>a serial port with a fixed baud rate, and
  <LI>an output for a single digit 7-segment display.
</UL>
<P>It is assumed that a suitable hardware exists.

<H2><A NAME="section_1_2">2.2 Top Level Design</A></H2>

<P>A CPU with I/O is a somewhat complicated beast. In order to
tame it, we brake it down into smaller and smaller pieces until
the pieces become trivial.

<P>The trick is to perform the breakdown at points where the connection
between the pieces is weak (meaning that it consists of only a
few signals).

<P>The top level of our FPGA design, and a few components around the
FPGA, looks like this:

<P><br>

<P><img src="avr_fpga.png">

<P><br>

<P>This design consists of 2 big sub-components <STRONG>cpu</STRONG> and <STRONG>ino</STRONG>, a small
sub-component <STRONG>seg</STRONG>, and some local processes like <STRONG>clk_div</STRONG> and <STRONG>deb</STRONG> that
are not broken down in other VHDL files, but rather written directly
in VHDL.

<P><STRONG>cpu</STRONG> and <STRONG>ino</STRONG> are described in lessons 4 and 8.

<P><STRONG>seg</STRONG> is a debug component that has the current program counter (<STRONG>PC</STRONG>)
of the CPU as input and displays it as 4 hex digits that show up one
by one with a short break between every sequence of hex digits. Since
<STRONG>seg</STRONG> is rather board specific, we will not describe it in detail in
this lecture.

<P>The local processes are described further down in this lesson. Before
that we explain the structure that will be used for all VHDL source file.

<H2><A NAME="section_1_3">2.3 General Structure of our VHDL Files</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="section_1_3_1">2.3.1 Header and Library Declarations</A></H3>

<P>Each VHDL source file starts with a comment containing a copyright notice
(all files are released under the GPL) and the purpose of the file.
Then follows a declaration of the libraries being used.

<H3><A NAME="section_1_3_2">2.3.2 Entity Declaration</A></H3>

<P>After the header and libraries, the entity that is defined in the VHDL
file is declared. We declare one entity per VHDL file.
The declaration consists of the name of the entity,
the inputs, and the outputs of the entity. In this declaration the order
of input and outputs does not matter, but we try to stick to the convention
to declare the inputs before the outputs.

<P>There is one exception: the file <STRONG>common.vhd</STRONG> does not define an entity,
but a VHDL package. This package contains the definitions of constants
that are used in more than one VHDL source file. This ensures that changes
to these constants happen in all files using them.

<H3><A NAME="section_1_3_3">2.3.3 Entity Architecture</A></H3>

<P>Finally, the architecture of the entity is specified. The
architecture consists of a header and a body.

<P>In the header we declare the components, functions, signals, and
constants that are used in the body.

<P>The body defines how the items declared in the header are
being used (i.e. instantiated, interconnected etc.). This body
contains, so to say, the "intelligence" of the design.

<H2><A NAME="section_1_4">2.4 avr_fpga.vhd</A></H2>

<P>The top level of our design is defined in <STRONG>avr_fpga.vhd</STRONG>. Since this
is our first VHDL file we explain it completely, line by line. Later
on, we will silently skip repetitions of parts that have been described
in other files or that are very similar.

<H3><A NAME="section_1_4_1">2.4.1 Header and Library Declarations</A></H3>

<P>avr_fpga.vhd starts with a copyright header.

<P><br>

<P>The libraries used are more or less the same in all VHDL files:

<P><br>

<pre class="vhdl">

 28	library IEEE;
 29	use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
 30	use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_ARITH.ALL;
 31	use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED.ALL;
 32	
<pre class="filename">

</pre></pre>
<P>

<P><br>

<P>The only Xilinx specific components needed for this lecture are the block RAMs.
For functional simulation we provide compatible components written in
VHDL. For FPGAs from other vendors you can probably include their
FPGA libraries, but we have not tested this.

<H3><A NAME="section_1_4_2">2.4.2 Entity Declaration</A></H3>

<P>For a top level entity, the inputs and outputs of the entities are
the pins of the FPGA.

<P>For a lower level entity, the inputs and outputs of the entity are
associated ("connected") with the inputs and outputs of the instance
of the entity in a higher level entity. For this to work,
the inputs and outputs of the declaration should match the component
declaration in the architecture of another entity that instantiates
the entity being declared.

<P>Since we discuss the top-level, our inputs and outputs are pins of
the FPGA. The top level entity is declared like this:

<P><br>

<pre class="vhdl">

 33	entity avr_fpga is
 34	    port (  I_CLK_100   : in  std_logic;
 35	            I_SWITCH    : in  std_logic_vector(9 downto 0);
 36	            I_RX        : in  std_logic;
 37	
 38	            Q_7_SEGMENT : out std_logic_vector(6 downto 0);
 39	            Q_LEDS      : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
 40	            Q_TX        : out std_logic);
<pre class="filename">
src/avr_fpga.vhd
</pre></pre>
<P>

<P><br>

<P>We therefore have the following FPGA pins:

<TABLE border="1">
<THEAD><TR><TH>Pin</TH><TH>Purpose</TH></TR></THEAD>
<TBODY>
<TR><TD>I_CLK_100</TD><TD>a 100 MHz Clock from the board.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>I_SWITCH</TD><TD>a 8 bit DIP switch and two single push-buttons.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>I_RX</TD><TD>the serial input of our UART.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Q_7_SEGMENT</TD><TD>7 lines to the LEDs of a 7-segment display.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Q_LEDS</TD><TD>4 lines to single LEDs</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Q_TX</TD><TD>the serial output of our UART.</TD></TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE>

<P>The lower 8 bits of <STRONG>SWITCH</STRONG> come from a DIP switch while the upper
two bits come from two push-buttons. The two push-buttons are used
as reset buttons, while the DIP switch goes to the I/O component from
where the CPU can read the value set on the switch.

<H3><A NAME="section_1_4_3">2.4.3 Architecture of the Top Level Entity</A></H3>

<P>The architecture has a head and a body, The head starts with the <STRONG>architecture</STRONG>
keyword. The body starts with <STRONG>begin</STRONG> and ends with <STRONG>end</STRONG>, like this:

<H4><A NAME="section_1_4_3_1">2.4.3.1 Architecture Header</A></H4>

<P>As we have seen in the first figure in this lesson, the top level
uses 3 components: <STRONG>cpu</STRONG>, <STRONG>io</STRONG>, and <STRONG>seg</STRONG>. These components have to
be declared in the header of the architecture.
The architecture contains component declarations,
signal declarations and others. We normally declare components and
signals in the following order:

<UL>
  <LI>declaration of functions
  <LI>declaration of constants
  <LI>declaration of the first component (type)
  <LI>declaration of signals driven by (an instance of) the first component
  <LI>declaration of the second component (type)
  <LI>declaration of signals driven by (an instance of) the second component
  <LI>...
  <LI>declaration of signals driven by local processes and the like.
</UL>
<P>The first component declaration <STRONG>cpu_core</STRONG> and the signals driven by its
instances are:

<P>The <STRONG>begin</STRONG> keyword in the last line marks the end of the header
of the architecture and the start of its body.

<H4><A NAME="section_1_4_3_2">2.4.3.2 Architecture Body</A></H4>

<P>We normally use the following order in the architecture body:

<UL>
  <LI>components instantiated
  <LI>processes
  <LI>local signal assignments
</UL>
<P>Thus the architecture body is more or less using the same order as
the architecture header. The component instantiations instantiate one
or more instances of a component type and connect the "ports" of the
instantiated component to the signals in the architecture.

<P>The first component declared was <STRONG>cpu</STRONG> so we also instantiate it first:

<P><br>

<pre class="vhdl">

109	    cpu : cpu_core
110	    port map(   I_CLK       => L_CLK,

</pre></pre>
<P>

<P><br>

<P>The first line instantiates a component of type <STRONG>cpu_core</STRONG> and calls
the instance <STRONG>cpu</STRONG>. The following lines map the names of the ports
in the component declaration (in the architecture header) to either
inputs of the entity, outputs of the entity, or signals declared in
the architecture header.

<P>We take <STRONG>cpu</STRONG> as an opportunity to explain our naming convention for signals.
Our rule for entity inputs and outputs has the consequence that all
left sides of the port map have either an <STRONG>I_</STRONG> prefix or an <STRONG>O_</STRONG> prefix.
This follows from the fact that a component instantiated in one architecture
corresponds to an entity declared in some other VHDL file and there the
<STRONG>I_</STRONG> or <STRONG>O_</STRONG> convention applies, 

<P>The next observation is that all component outputs either drive an entity
output or a local signal that starts with the letter chosen for the
instantiated component. This is the C_ in the <STRONG>cpu</STRONG> case. The <STRONG>cpu</STRONG> does
not drive an entity output directly (so all outputs map to <STRONG>C_</STRONG> signals),
but in the <STRONG>io</STRONG> outputs there is one driving an entity output (see below).

<P>Finally the component inputs can be driven from more or less anywhere, but
from the prefix (<STRONG>L_</STRONG> or not) we can see if the signal is directly driven
by another component (when the prefix is not <STRONG>L_</STRONG>) or by some logic defined
further down in the architecture (signal assignments, processes).

<P>Thus for the <STRONG>cpu</STRONG> component we can already tell that this component
drives a number of local signals (that are not entity outputs but inputs
to other components or local processes)&gt; These signals are those on
the right side of the port map starting with <STRONG>C_</STRONG>. We can also tell
that there are some local processes generating a clock signal <STRONG>L_CLK</STRONG>
and a reset signal <STRONG>L_CLR</STRONG>, and the <STRONG>ino</STRONG> component (which uses prefix <STRONG>N_</STRONG>)
drives an interrupt vector <STRONG>N_INTVEC</STRONG> and a data bus <STRONG>N_DOUT</STRONG>.

<P>The next two components being instantiated are <STRONG>ino</STRONG> of type <STRONG>io</STRONG> and
<STRONG>seg</STRONG> of type <STRONG>segment7</STRONG>:

<P>Then come the local processes.  The first process divides the 100 MHz
input clock from the board into a 25 MHz clock used by the CPU.

<P>Finally we have the signals driven directly from other signals. This
kind of signal assignments are the same as processes, but use a simpler
syntax for frequently used logic.

<P><STRONG>CLR</STRONG> is generated by inverting <STRONG>CLR_N</STRONG>. The serial input and the
serial output are visualized by means of two LEDs. The 7 segment output
can be driven from two sources: from a software controlled I/O register
in the I/O unit, or from the seven segment component (that shows the
current PC and opcode) being executed. The latter component is quite useful
for debugging purposes.

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> We use a <STRONG>_N</STRONG> suffix to denote an active low signal.
Active low signals normally come from some FPGA pin since inside
the FPGA active low signals have no advantage over active high signals.
In the good old TTL days active low signals were preferred for strobe
signals since the HIGH to LOW transition in TTL was faster than the LOW
to high transition. Some active low signals we see today are left-overs
from those days.<BR>
Another common case is switches and push-buttons that are held high
with a pull-up resistor when open and short-cut to ground when the
switch is closed.

<P>The following figure shows the breakdown of almost all components
in our design. Only the memory modules in <STRONG>sram</STRONG> and <STRONG>pmem</STRONG> and the
individual registers in <STRONG>regs</STRONG> are hidden because they would blow up the
structure without providing too much information.

<P>We have already discussed the top level <STRONG>fpga</STRONG> and its 3 components
<STRONG>cpu</STRONG>, <STRONG>ino</STRONG>, and <STRONG>seg</STRONG>.

<P>The <STRONG>cpu</STRONG> will be further broken down into a data path <STRONG>dpath</STRONG>, an opcode
decode <STRONG>odec</STRONG>, and an opcode fetch <STRONG>opcf</STRONG>. The data path consist of a
16-bit ALU <STRONG>alui</STRONG>, a register file <STRONG>regs</STRONG>, and a data memory <STRONG>sram</STRONG>.
The opcode fetch contains a program counter <STRONG>pcnt</STRONG> and a program memory <STRONG>pmem</STRONG>.

<P>The <STRONG>ino</STRONG> contains a <STRONG>uart</STRONG> that is further broken down into a baud rate
generator <STRONG>baud</STRONG>, a serial receiver <STRONG>rx</STRONG>, and a serial transmitter <STRONG>tx</STRONG>.
